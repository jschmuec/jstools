This is not a reall public project but please feel happy to take whatever of the code you like. It's just a collection of
functions and classes, that I did find handy again and again. If anybody likes the functionality of any of these, let me 
know if they should be contributed to some bigger projects and taken out of my hacky little library.

The packages pretty much explain what areas the functionality belongs to.
